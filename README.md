## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Always use header cells (th) not td for the header cells, and give them a scope of row.
- make tables width 100%
- make th and td elements width 50%
- give each cell a little padding.
- Never try to use large paddings to achieve a layouts.

### Continued development

Maybe try using gap since all the elements will be spaced the same. Here is a [discord thread](https://canary.discord.com/channels/824970620529279006/1410499692571394118) about when to use gap or margins
