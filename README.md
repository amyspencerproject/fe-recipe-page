## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Always use header cells (th) not td for the header cells, and give them a scope of row.
- make tables width 100%
- make th and td elements width 50%
- give each cell a little padding.

Never try to use large paddings to achieve a layouts.
